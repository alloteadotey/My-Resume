<h2>Ebenezer Allotey | Full Stack Web Developer</h2>
<h4>Location: Accra, Ghana</h4>
<hr/>
<p>
I am a dedicated Full Stack Web Developer based in Accra, <br/>
Ghana, with a passion for building scalable, user-centric web applications.  <br/>
My journey into software development was driven by a desire to solve local challenges <br/>
through global technology standards. I have cultivated my technical foundation through rigorous, <br/>
project-based learning on platforms like Udemy, where I specialized in modern JavaScript frameworks <br/>
and backend architecture.
